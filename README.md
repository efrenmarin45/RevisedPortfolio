# Revised Portfolio

## Purpose
This is a revised developer portfolio made to help bring all the components together for review. I knew I wanted to flesh out a concise and minimalistic portfolio but I wanted to put down all the components on a simplified plane first to gather my bearings. I will be submitting this to other engineers and mentors for feedback.  

## Project Status
The project is currently still being worked on and will remain a work in progress as my projects and skills continue to increase. 

## WIP Demo
